# LaserBeam

## Background

LazerBeam is a data visualization project showing the third party requests on the websites we are visiting.

The project is inspired from an open source project created by Mozilla in 2013 to help users understand the array of first and third party companies people interact with every day across the Web. It also educates users about the third-party trackers active on the websites they are browsing, in a perspective of data privacy. The project was deprecated in 2019. I really like the project and want to make a better version of it in terms of data visualization.

## Functionality and MVP

With LazerBeam, users will be able to:
 * 1. visualize the net links of popular websites(showed by logo) with top ranked third parties
 * 2. the overall net graph is presented in 3D and can be dragged and tranform wth different angles
 * 3. when hover on each logo, you can see the company name and website address
 * 4. top ranked third parties will be presented in bubbles with different sizes
 * 5. when click on one third party bubble, you can see a fadig beam from the third party to all other linked websites
